FPRoCK
------

*FPRoCK v-0.1* (February 2019)

*FPRoCK* (Floating-Point and Real ChecKer) is a prototype tool that decides the satisfiability of a mixed real and floating-point formula.
To this aim, it transforms a mixed formula into an equi-satisfiable one over the reals.
This transformed formula is then input to different off-the-shelf SMT solvers for resolution.
FPRoCK returns an assignment satisfying the formula if it exists; otherwise, it returns `unsat` indicating that the set is unsatisfiable.

The input to *FPRoCK* is a text file containing the following information:

* the list of floating-point variables with their precision (single or double) and *optional* initial range, for example:

```
Float: X[double] = [-2000.0;2000.0],
       Y[double] = [-2000.0;2000.0]
```

* the list of real variables with their *optional* initial range, for example:

```
Real: Real_X[real] = [-2000.0;2000.0],
      Real_Y[real] = [-2000.0;2000.0],
      Err_X[real],
      Err_Y[real]
```

* the set of constraints/formulas to check for satisfiability, for example:

```
Err_X >= abs(Real_X - X)
Err_Y >= abs(Real_Y - Y)
Err_X = 1.1368683772161603e-13
Err_Y = 1.1368683772161603e-13
```

In its current version, *FPRoCK* supports conjunctions (and), negations (not), equalities and disequalities (=, !=, <, >, <=, >=)  basic arithmetic operators over the reals (+,-,\*,/) and over the floats (+FP,-FP,\*FP,/FP), and the absolute value operator (abs).
Constant integer values are required to be written with a .0 at the end, e.g. 2.0. Scientific format is also accepted, e.g. 1.1368683772161603e-13.

Prerequisites
-------------

To install *FPRoCK* you will need to install:

* Python 2.7 and pip
    * install the `bigfloat` library with the command `pip install bigfloat`
* MathSAT (http://mathsat.fbk.eu/)
* Z3 (https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3)
* CVC4 (http://cvc4.cs.stanford.edu/web/)
* Colibri (https://soprano-project.fr/download_colibri.html)

The SMT solvers and the python interpreter should be available in the `PATH` environment variable.


Installation and use
--------------------

To install *FPRoCK* the repository has to be copied to a desired location. For example, with `git` we can clone the repository in the `/fprock` folder:

```
git clone https://github.com/nasa/FPRoCK.git /fprock
```

To execute *FPRoCK* the `executor.py` script has to be called from the root folder of the repository:

```
cd /fprock
python executor.py
```

The last command will display some usage help.

For example, to check the benchmark `eps-line/ceb_5.fpr` (which is `unsat`) you have to specify a timeout, a rounding mode and an input file in sequence, as in:

```
python executor.py 10 rnd-to-zero  benchmarks/eps_line/ceb_5.fpr
```

*FPRoCK* will create a directory `results` with one file of results for each combination of SMT solver and search strategy used.
The result of *FPRoCK* is the content of those files.
For example, to check the result of the previous example you can execute a command like:

```
cat results/*
```

And you would get an output like the following telling you that the formula is `unsat`:

```
unsat
(error "Cannot get the current model unless immediately preceded by SAT/INVALID or UNKNOWN response.")
unsat
(error "model generation not enabled")
unsat
(error "model generation not enabled")
unsat
(error "model generation not enabled")
unsat
(error "line 13029 column 10: model is not available")
unsat
(error "line 4344 column 10: model is not available")
unsat
(error "line 6580 column 10: model is not available")
```

Some result files maybe empty because the SMT timed out. The different results should all agree. If two different results `sat`/`unsat` are found for a problem it should be reported since it would imply an error in *FPRoCK* or in the underlying SMT solvers used.


Using Docker
------------

A `Dockerfile` is provided in the `/fprock/Docker/` folder in order to build a *Docker* image that can be use to install and run automatically *FPRoCK*.
The [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) tool has to be installed in order to use this approach.
The following commands build and run a *Docker* image with *FPRoCK*:

```
cd /fprock/Docker
docker build -t fprock .
docker run -it fprock /bin/bash
```

When running an *FPRoCK* image the tool is executed identically:

```
cd  /fprock
python executor.py 10 rnd-to-zero  benchmarks/eps_line/ceb_5.fpr
```
